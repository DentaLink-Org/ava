# VPS Team: HTTPS Support Required for Vercel Integration

**Date:** July 5, 2025  
**From:** Vercel Integration Team  
**To:** VPS Backend Team  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocking Production Integration

## Current Status

Your VPS server at `http://69.62.69.181:3001` is running perfectly and all endpoints are operational! 🎉

However, we've identified a **critical security issue** preventing integration with our Vercel deployment.

## The Problem: Mixed Content Security Block

**Issue:** Modern browsers block HTTP requests from HTTPS websites for security reasons.

- ✅ **VPS Server:** `http://69.62.69.181:3001` (HTTP)
- ✅ **Vercel App:** `https://ava-self.vercel.app` (HTTPS)
- ❌ **Result:** Browser blocks all HTTP requests from HTTPS pages

**Error in browser console:**
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://ava-self.vercel.app/playground' 
was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure HTTP resource 
'http://69.62.69.181:3001/api/jobs'. This request has been blocked.
```

## Impact on Features

Currently **completely broken** from Vercel:
- ❌ Job submission fails immediately  
- ❌ SSE progress tracking cannot establish connection
- ❌ All real-time features non-functional
- ❌ Components show "Connection Error" / "Disconnected" status

## Required Solution: Enable HTTPS Support

### Option 1: SSL Certificate + HTTPS Port (Recommended)
Configure your VPS server to support HTTPS on port 3001:

```bash
# Install SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt example)
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d 69.62.69.181

# Update your Express.js server to support HTTPS
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const httpsOptions = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/private-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/certificate.pem')
};

https.createServer(httpsOptions, app).listen(3001, () => {
  console.log('HTTPS Server running on port 3001');
});
```

**New VPS URL:** `https://69.62.69.181:3001`

### Option 2: Reverse Proxy with Nginx (Alternative)
Set up Nginx as an HTTPS reverse proxy:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name 69.62.69.181;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Option 3: Cloudflare SSL (Easiest)
- Point a domain to your IP (e.g., `vps.yourdomain.com`)
- Enable Cloudflare SSL proxy
- Access via `https://vps.yourdomain.com`

## Additional Requirements

### 1. API Credentials
We need the actual authentication values:

```bash
# What should these be set to in Vercel?
VPS_API_KEY=?????
VPS_API_SECRET=?????
```

### 2. CORS Update
Update your CORS configuration to allow HTTPS:

```javascript
// Current (working)
'https://ava-self.vercel.app'

// After HTTPS implementation, ensure this still works
```

### 3. SSE Headers for HTTPS
Ensure your Server-Sent Events work over HTTPS:

```javascript
res.writeHead(200, {
  'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
  'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
  'Connection': 'keep-alive',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://ava-self.vercel.app',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Cache-Control',
  // Add HTTPS-specific headers if needed
});
```

## Testing & Verification

Once HTTPS is enabled, we can test:

1. **Diagnostic Check:** `https://ava-self.vercel.app/api/vps/diagnose`
2. **Health Check:** `https://69.62.69.181:3001/health` (should work in browser)
3. **Job Submission:** Test from Vercel playground
4. **SSE Connection:** Real-time progress tracking

## Timeline

**Critical Priority:** This is blocking all VPS integration features on production.

**Estimated Work:** 
- Option 1 (SSL Certificate): 2-4 hours
- Option 2 (Nginx Proxy): 1-2 hours  
- Option 3 (Cloudflare): 30 minutes

## Questions for VPS Team

1. **Which HTTPS option do you prefer?** (SSL cert, Nginx proxy, or Cloudflare)
2. **What are the actual API key/secret values** we should use?
3. **Do you need any specific HTTPS configuration** for your current PM2 setup?
4. **Timeline:** When can you implement HTTPS support?

## Our Readiness

✅ **Vercel Side Complete:**
- All API routes properly proxy requests
- Authentication system ready
