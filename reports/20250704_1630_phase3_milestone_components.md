- **Security**: Permission-based access and approval authority validation

**Business Value**:
- Ensures proper governance and compliance
- Reduces approval bottlenecks through escalation
- Provides audit trail for regulatory requirements
- Enables delegation for business continuity

### 3. Project Phase Manager (`ProjectPhaseManager.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Hierarchical phase management system for organizing milestones into logical project phases.

**Key Features**:
- **Phase Organization**: Group milestones into logical project phases
- **Phase Dependencies**: Define dependencies between phases with different relationship types
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time phase progress based on milestone completion
- **Gate Controls**: Phase gate approvals with configurable conditions
- **Drag-and-Drop Organization**: Visual milestone assignment to phases
- **Resource Planning**: Track resource requirements and allocations per phase
- **Phase Lifecycle**: Manage phase status (not started, in progress, completed, etc.)
- **Multiple View Modes**: Timeline, board, and list views for different perspectives

**Technical Implementation**:
- **File**: `/src/components/playground/components/ProjectPhaseManager.tsx`
- **Phase Engine**: Manages phase lifecycle and dependencies
- **Progress Calculation**: Automatic progress tracking from milestone data
- **Drag-and-Drop**: React-based milestone assignment interface
- **Status Management**: Phase status transitions with validation

**Business Value**:
- Improves project organization and clarity
- Enables better resource planning and allocation
- Provides executive-level project visibility
- Supports complex project structures and dependencies

## Technical Architecture
