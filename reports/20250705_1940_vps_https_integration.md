# VPS HTTPS Integration Implementation Report

**Date:** July 5, 2025, 7:40 PM  
**Branch:** dev  
**Status:** Ready for Production Deployment

## Summary

Successfully implemented HTTPS integration for VPS server connection, resolving the mixed content security issues that prevented Vercel from communicating with the VPS backend.

## VPS Team Achievements ‚úÖ

The VPS team successfully implemented HTTPS support:

- **üîê HTTPS Enabled:** `https://69.62.69.181` (was `http://69.62.69.181:3001`)
- **üéØ SSL Certificate:** Self-signed certificate for 365 days
- **üîë API Credentials Provided:**
  - `VPS_API_KEY`: `fcfcb7c41b2a47c4a51b0aaa08b55291e680ce2eaf557d68`
  - `VPS_API_SECRET`: `e2fbee3ff607f85aa8d50e1bb1a5ee77d441ac23a89f6a8b855b1ee8a88e2fc1`
- **üåê CORS:** Configured for `https://ava-self.vercel.app`
- **‚ö° All Endpoints:** Working over HTTPS with proper SSL redirect

## Vercel Integration Updates

### 1. Configuration Updates

**File:** `src/config/vps.ts`
- Updated default `apiUrl` from `http://localhost:4000` to `https://69.62.69.181`
- Maintains environment variable override capability

### 2. SSL Certificate Handling

**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/api/vps/jobs/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/vps/jobs/[jobId]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/vps/jobs/[jobId]/progress/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/vps/auth/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/vps/diagnose/route.ts`

**SSL Configuration:**
```typescript
// Handle self-signed SSL certificates for VPS server
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development') {
  process.env["NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED"] = "0";
}
```

This allows Node.js to accept the self-signed certificate from the VPS server in production.

### 3. Enhanced Diagnostics

**File:** `src/app/api/vps/diagnose/route.ts`

Added new validation checks:
- HTTPS URL validation
- SSL certificate handling status
- Mixed content issue detection
- Environment variable verification

### 4. Local Development Configuration

**File:** `.env.local`

Added VPS configuration for local testing:
```bash
VPS_API_URL=https://69.62.69.181
VPS_API_KEY=fcfcb7c41b2a47c4a51b0aaa08b55291e680ce2eaf557d68
VPS_API_SECRET=e2fbee3ff607f85aa8d50e1bb1a5ee77d441ac23a89f6a8b855b1ee8a88e2fc1
VPS_DEBUG=true
```

## Security Considerations

### Self-Signed Certificate Handling

**Browser Behavior:**
- Browsers will show security warnings when accessing `https://69.62.69.181` directly
- API requests from Vercel work correctly (server-to-server bypass certificate validation)
- Users may see SSL warnings if they visit VPS URLs directly

**Production Recommendations:**
1. **Domain-based SSL:** Consider using a domain name with proper SSL certificate
2. **Certificate Authority:** Use Let's Encrypt or commercial SSL for production
3. **Monitoring:** Track SSL certificate expiration (365 days from implementation)

### Environment Variable Security

**Vercel Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
VPS_API_URL=https://69.62.69.181
VPS_API_KEY=fcfcb7c41b2a47c4a51b0aaa08b55291e680ce2eaf557d68
VPS_API_SECRET=e2fbee3ff607f85aa8d50e1bb1a5ee77d441ac23a89f6a8b855b1ee8a88e2fc1
```

**Security Notes:**
- API credentials are server-side only (not exposed to client)
- All VPS communication goes through Vercel API routes
- No direct client-to-VPS connections

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Automated Diagnostics

**Endpoint:** `https://ava-self.vercel.app/api/vps/diagnose`

This endpoint will verify:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured
- ‚úÖ HTTPS URL validation
- ‚úÖ VPS server connectivity
- ‚úÖ SSL certificate acceptance
- ‚úÖ Authentication capability

### 2. Integration Testing

**VPS Components in Playground:**
1. **Job Submission:** Submit processing jobs via HTTPS
2. **Real-time Progress:** SSE streaming over HTTPS
3. **Job History:** Display completed job results
4. **Error Handling:** Proper SSL and network error management

### 3. End-to-End Workflow

**Test Sequence:**
1. Visit: `https://ava-self.vercel.app/playground`
2. Select: "VPS Integration" component group
3. Submit: Sample processing job
4. Monitor: Real-time progress updates
5. Verify: Job completion and results

## Deployment Requirements

### Vercel Environment Variables

**Action Required:** Set these in Vercel Dashboard:

```bash
VPS_API_URL=https://69.62.69.181
VPS_API_KEY=fcfcb7c41b2a47c4a51b0aaa08b55291e680ce2eaf557d68
VPS_API_SECRET=e2fbee3ff607f85aa8d50e1bb1a5ee77d441ac23a89f6a8b855b1ee8a88e2fc1
```

**Note:** These are already mentioned as being set in Vercel, but values may need to be updated to match the new credentials.
